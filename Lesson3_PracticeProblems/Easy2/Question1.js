//Given a string, return a new string that replaces every occurrence of the word "important" with "urgent":

let advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur.";


//my solution

console.log(advice.replace('important', 'urgent'));

//.replaceAll() replaces all occurrences instead of the first occurrence
